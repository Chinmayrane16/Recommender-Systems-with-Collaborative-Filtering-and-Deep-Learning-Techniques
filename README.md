I have used Movielens 100k ratings dataset to study about various Recommendation Techniques. Since the dataset size is small, I have used basic techniques but with more size we need to use hybrid and dimensionality reduction techniques. 

I have covered one such recommendation technique using autoencoder in another repository ([here](https://github.com/Chinmayrane16/DeepRecommender)). This is currently the second best recommendation technique, released by NVIDIA in 2017 named [Training Deep AutoEncoders for Collaborative Filtering](https://github.com/Chinmayrane16/DeepRecommender).
